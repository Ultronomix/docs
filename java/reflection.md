# Reflection
- Reflection is a type of Meta Programing
  - Code that reads and modifies your code
- With Reflection we can programmitcally edit our Java Programs
  - This is a very powerful ability
- Annotations are a popular place we see reflection
  - Annotations DO NOT actually *do* anything
  - Annotations can be read by Java Reflection to make meaningful changes
- Sky is the limit with reflection
  - Genrating code based off of classes
  - Faking out the compiler
    - Access private fields outside of the class
    - Directly edit the string pool
    - etc...
