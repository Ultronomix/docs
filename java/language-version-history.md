# Java Language Version History

What would become the Java language was initiated by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton in 1991. Intially known as *Project Oak*, it was originally designed with a plan for interactive television in mind, but cable technology was not developed enough to support the project's ambitions. The project would go on to be known briefly as *Green* before ultimately settling on its current name: **Java**.

The language's first publicly released implementation was Java 1.0 released in 1996 by Sun Microsystems. It's main draw was the "write once, run anywhere" concept that allowed for low-/no-cost runtimes on any platform. This platform-independence, along with the emphasis on security within the language, helped the language garner a dedicated community and usage in the early Internet. Major web browsers of the time began providing out-of-the-box support for Java applets to run. In its early days, Java was very much the king of the Internet.

Fast forward to today and we see the Java language less in the web browser, and more on the web server. According to the Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey, Java is the 5th most used programming language based on the responses from nearly 50,000 respondants. Though it has recently been usurped by Python as the top server-side programming language, Java still maintains a strong popularity with larger enterprise organizations due to its well-tested stability. 

Java's release cadence was initially not regular, with major version releases being anywhere from 2 to 5 years apart. It was only with Java 9 was a more regular (and fast-paced) release cadence introduced. From version 9 onward, there is a major version release every 6 months (every March and September).

**2002**
- J2SE 1.4 released

**2004**
- Version number was changed from 1.x to X.0 in order to "better reflect the level of maturity, stability, scalability and security of the J2SE"

  - Oldest version of Java with LTS (long-term support)
  - Free public updates and extended support from Oracle will be continued for non-commercial installations until December 2030 
  - This is arguably the best version to learn of Java as someone relatively new to programming. It supports 
  
**2017**
- Java SE 9 released 
  - Biggest change: Modularization of the JDK (Java Platform Module System). This is one of the main reasons why there is a large amount of technical debt with upgrading Java 8 applications to Java 9+.
