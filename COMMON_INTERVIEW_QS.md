**This is not necessarily a comprehensive list, but it should be an excellent start for client interviews, or any Java/Angular full stack role. All of the answers should be easily Google-able. Good luck!**
- *Keep in mind many full stack interviews these days include a coding challenge or two.* 
- *Coding challenges are typically on Java (reverse a string, fizzbuzz, sort an Array, etc) or SQL (select certain columns from a table, find the amount of records in a table, perform a join, etc.)*

## Etiquette Tips

- Dress AT LEAST business casual (button down, nice top), but definitely dress to impress (blazer, suit jacket, tie???).
- Face and look at camera at all times. Cameras on! If this is not possible, just tell your interviewer. 
- Avoid shifty eyes, or anything that makes it look like you're referring to resources.
- Beverages are fine, but avoid distracting beverages or containers (a big head-sided pitcher that says something like "JAGERMEISTER" would probably be distracting.)
- Please don't vape on camera, it should go without saying but it's come up twice now. 
- It's ok to say you're not sure, but still try to give an answer. Interviewers don't want to hear "IDK" and only "IDK". 
- Try to avoid filler words. An "um" here or there is fine, but try to replace them with silence where you can.
- Try to keep your answers as detailed yet concise as possible. There's a nice middle ground you can find between oversharing and undersharing. 
- To remedy interview nerves try to trick yourself into talking like you're talking to a friend. Imagine your friend asking these interview questions genuinely wanting to know.
- Write a song idea: write a small song (or any memorable cadence/pattern) for tricky topics to make it make sense. 
- Power pose: You can apparently trick your brain into relaxing and feeling more confident if you "power pose" before something stessful. One that comes to mind is stading up straight, hands on your hips or crossed, and chin up. Imagine a thin string pulling you up by your head.
