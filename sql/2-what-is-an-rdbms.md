# What is a RDBMS?

A relational database is simply:

*   an organized collection of related data
*   stored on either a disk or the cloud
*   accessible by possibly many concurrent users
*   generally separated into application areas
    *   one database may contain Human Resource (employee and payroll) data
    *   another may contain sales data
    *   another may contain accounting data

 
So, this can make managing our data difficult, since we will have so many different databases. There must be some solution, right?


*   **_There is! Databases are managed by, the aptly named, database management systems (DBMS)._**
 

DBMSs are responsible for a lot of things when it comes to managing our databases:

*   accessing data
*   inserting data
*   updating data
*   deleting data
*   securing data
*   maintaining data integrity
*   backing up and recovering data
*   optimizing performance
*   maximizing data availability
*   acting as an interface to other system programs

 

There are three traditional types of database management systems:

*   relational
*   hierarchical
*   network

 

Popular database management systems include:

*   Oracle Database 11g/12c (closed-source)
*   MySQL (open-source)
*   IBM's DB2 (closed-source)
*   Microsoft SQL Server (closed-source)
*   PostgreSQL (open-source)



Throughout this training program we will be using PostGreSQL, and will be working with this database through DBeaver, which is an integrated development environment for executing our SQL queries and commands.
